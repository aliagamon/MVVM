# MVVM
Unity MVVM
A way of making unity UI more organized

This framework provides you a reactive way of making UIs using UniRx, and you can use this to seperate Logic and UI from each other.

This way you can have your logic written in normal C# code and this gives you the ability to easily write Test Cases and reusing logic in the server side for Input validation and Anti cheat strategies.

This framework is 100% async and it comes with Dependency Injection, Message Broker, Dialogue Service, Navigation Service for moving between scenes, Reactive Binding including One-way binding, Two-way binding, Event binding, Visibility binding and Collection binding which you can use converters to convert Input/Output values and all of this are done in editor without any code.

It's have Binding Debugger for debugging all these reactive binds in edit mode or playing.

It also have a Localization Service supporting both JSON and CSV files as translation table.

There is no documentation yet, But i've used this in quite a lot of commercial projects. I will add documentation later myself but any contribution is welcomed.
